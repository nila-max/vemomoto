VeMoMoTo - Vector Movement Modelling Tools 
==========================================

Vector movement modelling tools is a collection of python packages aiming to model the movement of invasive species or disease vectors through road networks. 

- The package :doc:`hybrid_vector_model <hybrid_vector_model>` provides the core functionality for the model. 

- The package :doc:`lopaths <lopaths>` contains an algorithm to identify locally optimal routes in road networks. These routes are in particular a necessary requirement for the hybrid vector model. 

- The package :doc:`ci_rvm <ci_rvm>` contains an algorithm to identify profile likelihood confidence intervals. This algorithm is in particular used to assess the hybrid vector model

- The package :doc:`vemomoto_core <vemomoto_core>` provides helpful tools required by the other packages


Installation
===============================================

The packages can be installed via pip. To install all packages, you may use 

.. code-block::

	pip install vemomoto

Installation instructions for the respective subpackages only can be found on the corresponding subpages.
