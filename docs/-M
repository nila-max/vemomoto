Maximizes the likelihood of the hybrid model.
        

        
        Parameters
        ----------
        processedSurveyData : dict
            Processed survey data, which are computed with :py:meth:`preprocess_survey_data`
        lengthsOfPotentialRoutes : :py:class:`csr_matrix_nd <vemomoto_core.npcollections.npext.csr_matrix_nd>`
            For each origin-destination pair the lengths of all potential
            (i.e. admissible) agent routes.
        trafficFactorModel : :py:class:`BaseTrafficFactorModel`
            Traffic factor model used to determine the strengths of the agent
            flows between the individual origin-destination pairs.
        routeChoiceParameters : float[]
            Route choice parameters. The first entry is the probability to 
            select an inadmissible path. The second entry is the exponent
            controlling the preference for shorter paths. The third entry is
            the probability that a given suvey location is on a randomly 
            selected inadmissible path.
        complianceRate : float
            Proportion of agents stopping at survey/inspection stations.
        properDataRate : float
            Fraction of agents providing inconsistent, incomplete, or wrong
            data.
        considered : bool[] 
            Which parameters are free? Is ``True`` at the entries corresponding 
            to the parameters that are free. ``considered`` must have exactly as 
            many ``True`` entries as the length of ``dynamicParameters``.             The first two entries must refer to the proportionality constant 
            and the parameter ``q`` and will be assumed to be ``True``.
        approximationNumber : int
            Degree of the Taylor approximation that is to be used. The higher 
            this number the more precise the likelihood will be but also the
            longer will the computation take. Must be `>= 1`.
        flowParameters : float[]
            If given, a model with these parameters will be used and assumed
            as being the best-fitting model.
        x0 : float[]
            Will be used as initial guess if given and if
            :py:obj:`flowParameters` is not given.
